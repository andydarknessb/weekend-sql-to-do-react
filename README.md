weekend-sql-to-do-react

## Description

This project is a simple To-Do list web application that helps users keep track of their tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily create, update, and delete tasks.

The problem this app solves is that sometimes people forget important tasks that they have to do, and often there are multiple tasks that need to be done at different times. This app helps users organize their tasks and stay on top of what they need to do.

To solve this problem, I used React.js to create the front-end interface of the app, and Node.js with Express to create the back-end server that handles the API requests. The app uses a Postgres database to store the tasks, and I used the Postico tool to interact with the database and create the necessary tables.

Prerequisites:

Node.js
Postgres
Installation:
To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone git@github.com:andydarknessb/weekend-sql-to-do-react.git
Change directory into the project folder: cd to-do-app
Install the dependencies: npm install
Create a new Postgres database named to_do_app
Run the queries in the tables.sql file to create the necessary tables and data
Start the server: npm run server
Start the client: npm run client
The app will now be running at http://localhost:5001
Usage:
A user can use the To-Do app as follows:

To add a new task, enter the task description into the input field and click the "Create Task" button
To mark a task as complete, click the "Mark Complete" button next to the task
To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task
Built With:

React.js
Node.js
Express
Postgres
